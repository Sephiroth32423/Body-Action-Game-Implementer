# 🕹️ Body Action Game Implementer
- A gesture-controlled, camera-based real-time game controller built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. This project enables full-body interaction with games using hand and body movements instead of traditional input devices.

# 📌 Abstract
- This system captures player movements via a webcam and converts them into game commands such as jump, roll, and move left/right. It eliminates the need for physical controllers by using gesture recognition, enhancing accessibility and user engagement. The project is ideal for applications in gaming, education, fitness, and rehabilitation.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries:
- OpenCV (image processing)
- MediaPipe (pose & hand detection)
- PyAutoGUI (simulate keyboard actions)
- Platform: PC, webcam-enabled
